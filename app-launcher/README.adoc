= Bndly ebx app-launcher

eBX application for usage during integration tests

eBX can be started from here (after build) with

`mvn bndly:run`

which launches a felix with all bundles and configurations from `app-launcher/src/main/prov/provisioning-ebx.json` and starts a jetty webserver on port 8082 configurable in pom.xml:
[code,xml]
----
    <jetty.port>8082</jetty.port>
----

The provisioning format is comparable with sling osgi features format, but was developed by cybercon a couple of years earlier.

The main entry point is http://localhost:8082/bndly with user ebx and password ebx configurable in provisioning-ebx.json:
[code,json]
----
"org.bndly.rest.api.account.InitialAccount-ebx": {
    "accountName": "ebx",
    "password": "ebx"
},
----
Swagger-Documentation can be reached by http://localhost:8082/bndly/swagger.json.
Be prepared, it is a very large json file.
